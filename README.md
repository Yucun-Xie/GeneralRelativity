# GeneralRelativity_Notes
These are my study [notes](/Notes) and [solution](/Solutions) to some textbooks for general relativity. I try to make it as clear and understandable as possible, and I will keep updating new chapters.

In the  [Solution](/Solutions) directory I include my hand writen solution to some popular textbook.
